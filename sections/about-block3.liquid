                                John and Jane met on a backpacking adventure in Nepal. John, a former sheep shearer,
                                went on the trip to get some clarity about his next adventures in life. Jane — a Peloton
                                instructor — went on the trip to explore the landscape in Nepal.

                                Returning back to their home state of Oklahoma, John and Jane hatched a plan to launch a
                                retail store centered around their passions.

                                <br>
                                <br>

                                While John handled the sourcing of goods and customer service, Jane focused on the web +
                                e-commerce side of the business, building this website in the best design platform on
                                the web — Webflow!
                                <br>
                                <br>

                                In 1989, John and Jane Doe officially launched Acme Outdoors, the premiere store for
                                outdoor enthusiasts around the state.

                                <br>
                                <br>
                                To this day, John and Jane return to Nepal yearly to ensure that they never forget their
                                roots and where they came from
